# Hotel-Cancellation_Prediction üè®ü•á‚úîÔ∏è
This project aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model to determine the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations. With the rise of online booking platforms and the prevalence of flexible cancellation policies, the rate of cancellations has become a significant challenge for revenue management in the hotel industry. The global average cancellation rate of nearly 40% indicates a negative impact on revenue and distribution strategies.

By leveraging data and advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to build a model that can accurately predict the characteristics and factors contributing to booking cancellations. This predictive capability will enable hotels to optimize revenue generation by implementing targeted strategies to mitigate cancellations and allocate resources more efficiently. By reducing cancellations and enhancing occupancy rates, hotels can improve revenue streams and minimize costs associated with booking fluctuations.

The project will explore various machine learning algorithms, perform feature engineering, and analyze historical data to train and validate the model's performance. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust and reliable solution that empowers hotels to make informed decisions, optimize revenue management strategies, and maximize profitability in the face of high cancellation rates.

Overall, this project will provide valuable insights and predictive power to hotel revenue managers, enabling them to mitigate revenue loss, enhance occupancy rates, and implement effective strategies to minimize the impact of booking cancellations.
